## Installation to Home Assistant
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FReproduktor%2FExtendedAwayStateBlueprintHassio%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FExtendedAwayState.yaml)

Or import to HA [from GitHub](https://github.com/Reproduktor/ExtendedAwayStateBlueprintHassio/blob/64d16860f8f4637aff34cc243499ada4981d6161/ExtendedAwayState.yaml)

## Description

This automation maintains a boolean helper, indicating if a person or device is away from home for an extended (configurable) amount of time. To configure, two helpers need to be provided for the automation to function properly.  
For increased robustness, the automation is triggered when Hassio restarts, as well as every midnight, and either resets the Extended away status (if the person is at home), or starts the timer (if the person is not at home). This way, even if leaving/entering home zone events are missed for some reason, the extended away state will eventually be corrected.


## Parameters
- **Person** An entity to track. It is designed for either a *person* entity, or *device_tracker* entity, but any entity which indicates home presence by being set to state 'home' will work
- **Extended away indicator** A helper of type `input_boolean`. This value will be set by this automation to `on`, when the person is away from home for more than the defined amount of time. The value will be reset to `off` as soon as the person returns home.
- **Extended away time** Time, in hours, after which the person is considered away for an extended amount of time.
- **Timer** A helper of type `timer`, which is needed by this automation to count down when the person leaves from home.

## Hints
I use this automation for every home member independently. My schema is:
1. Create `input_boolean` helpers for each person: `input_boolean.extendedaway_person1`, `input_boolean.extendedaway_person2`, ...
2. Create `timer` helpers for each person: `timer.extendedawaytimer_person1`, `timer.extendedawaytimer_person2`, ...
3. Based on this blueprint, create automations for each person: `Maintain an 'extended away' state for Person1`, `Maintain an 'extended away' state for Person2`, ...

## Practical applications
I use the state for controlling, to whom the notifications from Home Assistant will be sent. In my scenario, I have a script which delivers a given message to family members, that are home-ish. The script is like this:
```yaml
notify_family_members_at_home_these_days:
  alias: Notify family members at home these days
  icon: mdi:bell-badge-outline
  description: "Whoever is not away for extended period of time, gets notified."
  mode: queued
  max: 10
  fields:
    message:
      name: Message
      description: "Message to send"
      selector:
        text:
    title:
      name: Title
      description: "Title of the message to send"
      selector:
        text:
  sequence:
  - choose:
    - conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.extendedaway_person1
        state: 'off'
      sequence:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_person1
        data:
          message: "{{ message }}"
          title: "{{ title }}"
  - choose:
    - conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.extendedaway_person2
        state: 'off'
      sequence:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_person2
        data:
          message: "{{ message }}"
          title: "{{ title }}"

# ... etc ...

    default: []

```
